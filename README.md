3 inputs selected by the position CV input (< -1.7 volt selects the bottom input, > +1.7 volt selects the top input and else the middle is selected.
position input's normal is a counter that can by clocked by an input or the push button and has a reset input.
position input has a mult so you can send it to another switch or other modules.

#Aluminium front panel
The front panel is a single layer "circuit" on aluminium with white soldermask. The jacks and switches have a space around without soldermask, so the panel is grounded.
I made the text really small, because I think it is less usefull after a while. It is more like a manual.
