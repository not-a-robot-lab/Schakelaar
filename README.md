## Aluminium front panel
The reason I choose aluminium as material for the front panel is because it is recyclable. PCB (FR-4) material is not recyclable.
I also tried wood panels, I like them. But it takes a more efford to print on. I will also try Acrylic one day, just to try. It is better then FR-4 but I think less well for the environment as Aluminium.
The front panel is a single layer "circuit" on aluminium with white soldermask. The jacks and switches have a space around without soldermask, so the panel is grounded.

I made the text really small, because I think it is less usefull after a while. It is more like a manual.
